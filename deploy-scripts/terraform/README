STEPS TO GET THIS TERRAFORM WORKING:

1) Install Terraform. Instructions at https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli.
2) Clone/download the terraform-provider-twilio repo located at https://github.com/appian/terraform-provider-twilio.
3) You need to build the plugin in order to use it, and to build it you need to install Go 1.12. There's various guides online for this. I had to try several things on Linux to get it to work, so good luck.
4) Build the plugin, and follow the git repo directions on where to put it.
5) Run "terraform init" in this folder.
6) Run "terraform apply -var-file=staging.tfvars"
